title: "10 Cool Corporate Open Source Contributors You Didn't Think Of"

I had the idea for this post after accidentally stumbling across [KrakenJS](http://krakenjs.com/) and realising its a Paypal open source project. 

OK so its pretty obvious companies like Google, RedHat, Oracle, etc all contribute to the open source community and even stand on its shoulders to a great extent. But after finding Paypal's contributions I did some digging to find some lesser known coroporate open source contributors. And some cool projects popped up.

There was a time when I'd do a lot of coding using Google API's and open source libraries but over the years I'd become dissillusioned with them and as a result subconciously steered clear of any future corporately sponsored projects.

### Quick KrakenJS intro before the main list
Not only is KrakenJS a much beefed up version of the Node framework ExpressJS with lads of extras including:

* Application Security
* NPM Proxy
* Dust I18N
* Dust Context

It's also a way to structure your project. It is like [Sinatra's](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) [Padrino](http://www.padrinorb.com/) of the Ruby world.

## 1. Paypal
As I've already mentioned Paypal's greatest contribution (<acrnym title="In My Humble Opinion">IMHO</acronym>) KrakenJS here's **[Paypals GitHub page with all their projects](http://paypal.github.io/)**:

* [KrakenJS](http://krakenjs.com/) - As above.
* [NemoJS](http://paypal.github.io/nemo/) - Selenium web driver.
* [SeLion](http://selion.io/) - Java test automation
* [HTML5 Video Player](http://paypal.github.io/accessible-html5-video-player/) - WTF?! (unexpected)
* [AATT](http://github.com/paypal/AATT/) - Automated Accessiblity Testing Tool
* [Bootstrap Accessibility Plugin](http://paypal.github.io/bootstrap-accessibility-plugin/)
* [Paypal SDKs](http://paypal.github.io/sdk/) - for accessing their platform via API.

## 2. Netflix
First it was a major banking organisation. Now we've the darling of media streaming services to the public and paraiah to US ISPs.

The Netflix open source contribution is no less impressive than PayPals - maybe even more so which is why its criminal its not more widely known. So here's a heads up on their:

* [Tech Blog](http://techblog.netflix.com/)
* [Git Hub Repos](https://github.com/Netflix)

Some of their notable projects:

* [Asgard](https://github.com/Netflix/asgard) - Web interface for application deployments and cloud management in Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* [Scumblr](https://github.com/Netflix/Scumblr) - cool custom search engine. Check the page for full info.
* [SimianArmy](https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy) - Tools for keeping your cloud operating in top form.


## 3. Spotify

* [Developer Blog](https://developer.spotify.com/)
* [GitHub Repos](https://github.com/spotify)

Some of their projects:
* [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) - Flexible workflow and data piping library written in Python. Great docs for this project too and even has [built in workflow visualisation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spotify/luigi/master/doc/user_recs.png).
* [Puppet Explorer](https://github.com/spotify/puppetexplorer) - Puppet web interface written in CoffeeScript using AngularJS.
