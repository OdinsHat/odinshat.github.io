# My First APC Prouject In a Project Box

This project has been a long tiume inclubating as a draft as I kept making adjustments and changes. Eventually I thoughjt I neeed to publish this thing as its been under draft for 5 months now. So the APC was finished in December but the box and blog was finished today.

## What I Created

A [Rakit Atari Punk Console] kit with Depth & Pitch control packaged into an old JVC earphones box with a PP3 battery holder superglued to the back. With an all important sticker!

## How I Found What I wanted

I decided to get into DIY electronic kits after seeing the huge number available on BangGood.com. Before I came to Rakits I'd made DIY clocks with temperature and light sensors, multiple failed radios (they're my weakness), power supplies, speaker kits, etc. 

But it didn't take long for my industrial music loving brain to come up with the following important formula:

<blockquote>DIY Electronics + Like Noise = DIY Noise Making</blockquote>

So then I went hunting for noise making devices I could hook up to my speakers or just make noise with. I remember an interview with someone from Throbbing Gristle where they openly admitted knowing not a single thing about making music but they enjoyed making noise. Having owned an electric guitar for about 6years and still not being able to get past 3 chords I sympathised and wanted to make noise too but with someth9ing I'd built myself. 

## Coming Across Rakit

I came across [my first Rakit first via eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/RAKIT-Atari-Punk-Console-KIT-DIY-electronic-project-circuit-bending-synthesiser-/162201777024). Their [eBay store has the full collection](https://www.ebay.co.uk/usr/makearakit1982?_trksid=p2047675.l2559) but they have [their own site with tons of options](https://www.rakits.co.uk/shop/) and a great [informative blog](https://www.rakits.co.uk/blog/) that's well worth checking out. 

My first Rakit was the [Atari Punk Console](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/RAKIT-Atari-Punk-Console-KIT-DIY-electronic-project-circuit-bending-synthesiser-/162201777024) which did exactly what I wanted - make noise! I also got a [sequencer](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Baby-8-step-sequencer-electronic-project-kit-by-Rakit/162216285067?hash=item25c4d8138b:m:mypNfhLEDs-80QCmprfB5Zg) - that was a mistake! Too soon! It ended up with the LED's on the wrong side, all messed up and I gave up part way and resigned myself to a new one form their site!

Don't be overconfident and take the advice on their sites shop for each item as to how difficult they are - also be worth checking out the [Assembly Guides](https://www.rakits.co.uk/assembly-guides/) which are there too.

## Building a Box for my First Rakit

Having done a lot of kits that came with their own box I felt my first rakit needed one but only something simple and preferably recycled form the multitude of bits and pieces of cruft I have lying around.

### An Old JVC earphones box

At first I thought I could fit the battery and circuit into the box and be donbe with it but I lacked a few things such as....

* a drill.
* drill bits for small holes and big holes.
* a ruler
* **everything to make a proper project box work!!**

So I bought my above list of atefacts online while constructing my APC 

I set about creating padding for the base where the Rakit would sit

At first I was planning on using the battery clip cable that came with the kit but after finding out that my supergluing it to the PCB and melting the insulation to it that I needed to find a replacement and reover the situation. I'd recently bought a job lot of about 25 PP3 battery holders so I superglued one to the back after drilling holes for the terminals to slide into that would come up behind the PCB inside the case. See pictures below...

## Its Important To Keep a Clean Work Area

## What I Learnt

* Superglue makes wire insulation melt and potentially merge and short circuit wires.
* Quick component testers are sometimes faster than a multimetre at giving you a resistor or capacitor value.
* Making noise is awesome.
* The continuity tester on my multimetre is great. 
* I'm not very good at making project boxes look good.
* I have a renewed respect for the [people at Rakits and for their designs and the work that goes into them. It ain't easy!
* I like stickers!!
* I'm a sucker for sweets!
* It's possible to fiddle with the the boards components in paralell to make noises in different ways. Such as sticking POT terminals over a resistor and you get weird extra/other noises.
* One of my next projects will involve 'breaking out' every component including those that aren't meant to be to create a Muti-Pot Mega APC!
