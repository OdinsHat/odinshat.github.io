## What I Ended Up With

An Atari Punk Console kit with Depth & Pitch contrl packaged into an old JVC earphones box with a PP3 batteryt holder superglued to the back. With an all important sticker! 

## How I Got There

I decided to get into DIY electronic kits after seeing the huge number available on BangGood.com. Before I came to Rakits I'd made DIY clocks with temperature and light sensors, multiple failed radios (they're my weakness), power supplies, speaker kits, etc. 

But it didn't take long for my industrial music loving brain to come up with the following important formula:

<blockquote>DIY Electronics + Like Noise = DIY Noise Making</blockquote>

So then I went hunting for noise making devices I could hook up to my speakers or just make noise with. I remember an interview with someone from Throbbing Gristle where they openly admitted knowing not a single thing about making music but they enjoyed making noise. Having owned an electric guitar for about 6years and still not being able to get past 3 chords I sympathised and wanted to make noise too but with someth9ing I'd built myself. 

## Coming Across Rakit

I came across [my first Rakit first via eBay](https://ebay.to/2J9uezf). I got the Atari Punk Console which did exactly what I wanted - make noise! I also got a sequencer that was a mistake. Too soon!!

## Building a Box for my First Rakit

## What I Learnt

* Superglue makes wire insulation melt and potentially merge and short circuit wires.
* I'm not very good at making project boxes look good.
* I like stickers!!
