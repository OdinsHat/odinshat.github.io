# Early 1980's

Born, got access to my first PC at the age of 4 or 5. started copying 
programs in Amstrad BASIC into my dad's Amstrad CPC 6128. BASIC probably 
wasn't the best first language to experiment with but as a kid I
 was just desperate to hack away with anything and everything. I still 
 have that same Amstrad computer with me today pictured below. It works 
though I don't bother to switch it on these days.
