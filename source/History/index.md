## Early 1980's

Born, got access to my first PC at the age of 4 or 5. I think it was my dad's but he didn't get much time on ut from what I remember. It was an Amstrad CPC 6128 - the exact one pictured below. I've held onto all these years. I started my programming back then in Amstrad BASIC.

BASIC probably wasn't the best first language to experiment with but as a kid I was just desperate to hack away with anything and everything. I still  have that same Amstrad computer with me today pictured below. It works and here's a vieo to prove it:

## Mid 90's

Skipping Primary school lets hit High School. Poynton High School taught me very little other than the fact Research Machines were everywhere. At school I learnt how to make text **bold** in Word. At home I was learnign to program in Pascal, C++ (as I'd heard of C and ++ must mean its WAY better!!).

## Late 90's
Towards the end of high school I'd dabbled in BASH scripting, C, C++ and Java. As well as the usual teenage tech enthusiasts desire to "hack/crack" everything he could. Joining the now defunct "CyberArmy" to hone my 7337 5killz (did I get that right? My memory is foggy).
