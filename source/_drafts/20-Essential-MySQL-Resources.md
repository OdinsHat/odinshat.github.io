Anyone who’s spent more than 5 minutes on the MySQL documentation will realise it leaves a lot to be desired.  The same goes for many of the 3rd party apps latched onto this platform which offer mediocre functionality and anything beyind the basic comes at a huge premium.

Well here’s a set of 20 resources, tools, articles that hope to break that and bring it all under one roof.  Enjoy.

## Design & Administration Tools

* [Adminier](https://www.adminer.org/) - 
* [MyDB Studio](http://www.mydb-studio.com/) - Makes a useful administration app for MySQL and also has some design capabilities such as the SELECT wizard to help with overly complicated queries.
* [HeidiSql](http://www.heidisql.com/) - Provides an excellent GUI for administrating you MySQL database and can be used in Linux via WINE.

* AutoMySQLBackup - Why go to the special effort of producing scripts to backup when you can use this.
* PHPMyAdmin - Been around for years and still going strong.  Its not the most speedy when handling large sets of data (try offline apps such as SQLYog or MyDB) but its got every functionality you can shake a stick at.
* LibreOffice Base - I know its certainly an unusual one to incude in the list but OpenOffice Base does have good support for working on a MySQL system using its Java interface.  Worth a look but if you have a huge database then it can take a performance knock.
